# Bitmain Pricing Algorithm ðŸ“Š

A comprehensive pricing algorithm and analysis tool for historical Bitmain ASIC miner prices, based on real market data and guaranteed historical prices.

## Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated pricing algorithm that accurately determines historical and current prices for Bitmain ASIC miners. The algorithm is based on:

- **Guaranteed historical prices** from actual invoices and market data
- **Market condition analysis** (bull/bear cycles)
- **BTC price correlation**
- **Supply and demand dynamics**
- **Hardware generation lifecycle patterns**

## Features

- ðŸ“ˆ **Historical Price Database**: Verified prices for S9, S17, S19 series and more
- ðŸ”„ **Dynamic Pricing Calculator**: Real-time price calculations based on market conditions
- ðŸ“Š **Market Analysis Tools**: Correlation analysis between BTC price and miner prices
- ðŸŽ¯ **Accuracy**: Based on guaranteed historical prices from actual transactions
- ðŸ“‰ **Price Interpolation**: Smart interpolation for dates without exact data
- ðŸ’¹ **Market Phase Detection**: Identifies bubble, crash, recovery, and normal periods

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitmain-pricing-algo.git
cd bitmain-pricing-algo
```

### Browser Usage
```html
<script src="simple-miner-pricing.js"></script>
<script src="bitmain-dynamic-pricing-calculator.js"></script>
```

### Node.js Usage
```javascript
const { getSimpleMinerPrice } = require('./simple-miner-pricing.js');
const BitmainPricingCalculator = require('./bitmain-dynamic-pricing-calculator.js');
```

## Usage Examples

### Get Historical Price
```javascript
// Get S9 price on specific date
const price = getSimpleMinerPrice('s9_135', '2018-01-03');
console.log(price); // 2830

// Get S19 price with interpolation
const s19Price = getSimpleMinerPrice('s19', '2021-06-15');
console.log(s19Price); // Interpolated price
```

### Dynamic Price Calculation
```javascript
const calculator = new BitmainPricingCalculator();
const result = calculator.calculatePrice('S9', 15000, '2017-12-08');
console.log(result); 
// { price: 1520, marketCondition: 'normal', multiplier: 1.09 }
```

### Market Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze price patterns during bubble
const analysis = analyzer.analyzeBubbleBehavior('2017-12');
// Shows: Miners can 3x in 12 days during extreme FOMO
```

## Pricing Insights

### Bubble Behavior (Dec 2017)
- S9 price **TRIPLED** from $1,520 to $4,500 in just 12 days
- Miner prices rose 3x faster than BTC price
- Extreme supply shortage and FOMO drove prices

### Crash Behavior (2018)
- Sticky prices during decline (slower to fall than BTC)
- Never below $650 floor (manufacturing cost + hardware value)
- Recovery rallies even in bear trends

### Price Floors
- S9: Never below $650
- S17: Never below $1,500
- S19: Never below $3,000
